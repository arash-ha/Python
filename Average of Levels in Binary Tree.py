Average of Levels in Binary Tree

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.
Example 1:
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
Explanation:
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
Note:
The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
